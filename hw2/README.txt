In each file, we defined a few constants. Please modify them to suit your environment. They are: 
1. workd: the directory you hold the Pima Indians dataset
2. filename: the file name of the Pima Indians dataset
3. epochs, epochStep, batchSize: SVM training parameters

After you change these values, in RStudio, just do following two steps:
1. hit Ctrl-A to select all lines of the code in one file
2. press Ctrl-Enter to run all the lines
Our script will clear your environment before running. 

There are two plotting scripts at the bottom of the file. One plotting accuracy against epochs, one plotting accuracy against batches. 

Accuracy on the testing data is in testAccu.
